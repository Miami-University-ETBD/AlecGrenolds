           <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
           <p><strong>Hi, I'm Alec</strong>, and I love dogs! I’ve always had a passion for dogs, and I wanted to create a website where others who love dogs could come together and share that love. I created this website to bring more joy and understanding about dogs to the world!</p>
           <p>Growing up, dogs were my constant companions, teaching me responsibility, patience, and the value of unconditional love. This site is my way of giving back to the dog community, offering a space for education, celebration, and connection. Whether you’re a long-time dog owner or just curious, there’s something here for you!</p>

           <h3>Why I Created This Website</h3>
           <p>I created this website because of my love for dogs and how they make life so much better. I wanted a space where people could celebrate dogs, learn some fun facts, and share their stories. I truly believe that dogs are family!</p>
           <p>Seeing the joy dogs bring to people inspired me to build this platform. It’s a place to showcase their incredible traits, from loyalty to playfulness, and to encourage others to adopt or care for these amazing animals. Every page is designed with dog lovers in mind!</p>

           <h3>Fun Fact About Me</h3>
           <p>I got my first dog, Greta, when I was 10 years old. She was my best friend, and we've been inseparable ever since! She’s a Boxer-Labrador mix with a heart of gold, and her playful spirit inspired this entire site. We’ve shared countless adventures, from park playdates to quiet afternoons on the couch.</p>
