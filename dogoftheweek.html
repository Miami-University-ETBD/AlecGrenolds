           <h2>Doggy Fun Facts to Woof About</h2>
           <p>Alright, let’s talk about why dogs are just the best, shall we? Did you know they’ve got this uncanny knack for figuring out our schedules? Like, Greta probably knows exactly when her dinner’s coming before her humans even grab the kibble bag. And get this—they don’t sweat like us; they cool off through their paws and by panting, which is why you’ll see them huffing and puffing on a hot day.</p>
           <p>Here’s another cool tidbit: dogs aren’t stuck seeing the world in black and white. Nope, they catch shades of blue and yellow, so Greta’s probably admiring the sky or her favorite toy in her own special way. These little quirks make dogs so fascinating, and we’ve got a handy table below to break down some of these awesome facts for you!</p>
