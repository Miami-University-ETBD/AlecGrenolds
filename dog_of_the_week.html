           <p>Hey folks, say hello to <strong>Greta</strong>, our star of the week! This 13-year-old Boxer-Labrador is basically sunshine in form of a dog. She’s got a thing for laying in the sun, chasing tennis balls like it’s her job, and snuggling up with her humans after a long day of fun. Her family says she’s the sweetest gal around, always ready with a wagging tail and a goofy grin to brighten your mood.</p>
           <p>We picked Greta because she’s the perfect mix of playful and chill which is exactly what you’d want in a furry best friend. Her dark coat shines just like her energy, and her love for life is contagious. Want to know more about her breed? Check out the fun facts below!</p>

           <h2>Doggy Fun Facts to Woof About</h2>
           <p>Alright, let’s talk about why dogs are just the best, shall we? Did you know they’ve got this uncanny knack for figuring out our schedules? Like, Greta probably knows exactly when her dinner’s coming before her humans even grab the kibble bag. And get this—they don’t sweat like us; they cool off through their paws and by panting, which is why you’ll see them huffing and puffing on a hot day.</p>
           <p>Here’s another cool tidbit: dogs aren’t stuck seeing the world in black and white. Nope, they catch shades of blue and yellow, so Greta’s probably admiring the sky or her favorite toy in her own special way. These little quirks make dogs so fascinating, and we’ve got a handy table below to break down some of these awesome facts for you!</p>
